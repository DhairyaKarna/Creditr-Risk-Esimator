# Credit Risk Estimator

This project involves developing a credit risk estimation model using various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on historical data.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classification
3. Random Forest
4. Neural Network
5. Deep Learning

## Project Structure

- `Credit_Risk_Estimation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the credit risk estimation model.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DhairyaKarna/Creditr-Risk-Esimator.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Creditr-Risk-Esimator
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Credit_Risk_Estimation.ipynb
    ```
2. **Run the notebook cells to train and evaluate the models.**

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should be placed in the project directory. Ensure that the dataset is properly preprocessed and cleaned before running the models.

## Results

The results of the various machine learning models, including their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics, will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook.
